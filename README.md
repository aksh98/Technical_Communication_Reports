# Technical_Communication_Reports

Here, I have three reports which I made for Technical Communication course:

- Virtual Reality where I have mentioned the summary of the current technical advancements in VR and the basic concepts being used.

- Entity Resolution in Online Social Media is where I summarized [this](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=6693350) paper 

- Third one is a presentation on Virtual Reality which I gave in class.
